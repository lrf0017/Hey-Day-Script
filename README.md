# Hey-Day-Script
* Hey Day is a long standing tradition on Auburn's campus. This year it is being celebrated on Wednesday, October 18th!
* Hey Day first became a thing in 1947 when Auburn's student body wanted to make students who served in WWII feel welcome when they arrived back on campus.
* To an outside person, Hey Day might seem like a weird tradition. It is simply where everyone wears a name tag and goes around saying hello and introducing themselves to eachother.
* It's main purpose is to encourage a welcoming and friendly environemnt throughout all of Auburn's campus.
